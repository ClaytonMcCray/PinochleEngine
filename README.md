# PinochleEngine
A game engine for two person pinochle (the original game).
I noticed that it was pretty much impossible to find a not-terrible or incomplete
digital, player v. computer pinochle game. So I started to write one. 

pinochle_engine.py is just a game engine; it does nothing on it's own but enumerates
the the processes of the game. CLIPinochle2.py is a CLI interface for playing the game. Eventually,
I might want to add a GUI. Right now, it's kind of fun to play at the terminal and it's good for
testing the engine.

To run the game, just invoke CLIPinochle2.py.
